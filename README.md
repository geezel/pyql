PyQL - QuantLib Cython wrappers
===============================

This library is a new set of wrappers using Cython on top of QuantLib.
It currently focuses on useful simple objects like Date, Calendar but
might be extended to more complex wrappers if needed.

This work started on QuantLib version 1.1 and 1.2 and is now requiring version
1.5 at least.

It offers support for Python 2 and 3.

Prerequisites
-------------

* [QuantLib](http://www.quantlib.org) (version 1.5 or higher)
* [Cython](http://www.cython.org) (version 0.22 or higher)
